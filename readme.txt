3D Presentation Plugin allows to manage a 3D Presentation in your WordPress site using impress.js.

== Description ==

3D Presentation Plugin allows to create, edit and publish an impress.js presentation in your WordPress site.
Impress.js is a framework by Bartek Szopka based on the power of CSS3 transforms and transitions in modern browsers and inspired by the idea behind prezi.com.

Installation comes with 13 Presentation Steps already loaded (in draft status) under the "3D Presentation" Content Type (demo from impress.js).
The 3D Presentation set up is available in Settings -> 3D Presentation. You can act on styles, set metadata, get Presentation link and restore defaults if necessary.    

Presentation Steps can be added, modified, deleted.

Each Step has:

* A content you set with your Visual/HTML editor
* A sequence number (Steps are cued in the Presentation by increasing sequence number)  
* An unique identifier (id) - optional 
* A 3D position (x,y,z)
* A scaling factor
* A 3D rotation (degrees)
* A step selector (for styling purposes) 

Presentation is published (for the readers with only the Steps in Publish status) at: 
{your site link}/index.php?3dpresentation=true
